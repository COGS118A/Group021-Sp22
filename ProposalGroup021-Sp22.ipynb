    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is to use NBA player data to create a machine learning algorithm that will predict the likelihood of a player becoming an all-star. We will be looking at different player statistics from each regular season from 2011/12 through 2021/22 to create a regression line that predicts the likelihood of a player becoming an all-star. Success will be measured by testing the created model with earlier stats from players who became all-stars and seeing how accurate the predictions are."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are looking to answer is to predict which NBA players have the most potential to become all-stars. We will be using a variety of player stats and variables to create a model that can predict the growth of a player, and use that predicted growth to make an educated guess about the likelihood that they will become an all-star in the future. Given that we will be using 10 seasons of player data to build our player growth model, we feel that the volume of data will be adequate to ensure that the model will have a solid base of relatively unbiased data. This problem will be able to be replicated and expanded quite easily by adding more seasons of player data and including a wider range of players. We will also be able to test the model many times because every season there are new all-stars that are selected, and we can use this information to check the accuracy of the player growth model and making accurate all-star predictions."

    "# Data\n",

Given that we will be working with 10 seasons of data from 2011/12 through 2021/22, we expect to have a dataset of about 5,000 - 6,000 observations and we will be looking at around 8 - 10 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_per_game.html\n",
    "- Each season has 500 - 600 observations, so 10 seasons of data will give 5,000 - 6,000 observations.\n",
    "- Each observation is a player. Each observation has 28 variables, including Games, Team, Points, Rebounds, etc. We will be reducing the number of variables to only include the most relevant ones in determining all-star selection.\n",
    "- Some critical variables that will be included (but not limited to): Points per Game, 2-Point Percentage, Position, Assists per Game\n",
    "- The data we will use from basketball reference is already very clean, but likely we will remove any players that were only in the NBA for 1 season (given no growth to track), players with no NBA minutes played, and reduce the number of variables we will be looking at."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the problem statement may still be subject to change, the current proposed problem statement is to create a machine learning program that could predict the success of a player based on their stats, measuring success as being part of an all-star team selection. We will use past all stars as the training subjects and test on this yearâ€™s all stars to determine how accurate the program is. One way that we can program this machine learning algorithm is by creating a boundary line that can separate non-allstars from all-stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might not be a viable solution due to the sheer number of ways players can impact winning basketball, but since nba all-stars historically are chosen due to their offensive impact, creating a boundary that favors offensive statistics like points and assists may help in creating a more accurate boundary. If there happens to be more than the total amount of all-star selections available, the program can choose players that are farther away from the boundary relative to other players and vice versa for the opposite scenario."

    "One metric thet we'll be using is Precision. The reason we'll be using Precision is because there are more college altheses that do not make it to the NBA than there are that do make it. Since it's highly selective, we believe that that there will be various fales positives in our data sets since the stats could be so similar. The formula for precision is: $$ \\frac{True \\ Positive}{True \\ Positive \\ + False \\ Positive} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be using an F1-Score in order to see where the cut off is in our model. We went against ROC because this data is not balanced. In order to find the F1 score, you must know recall, which is $$ \\frac{True \\ Positive}{True \\ Positive \\ + False \\ Neative} $$\n",
